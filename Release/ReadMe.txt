Name: RUBBUR
Creator: Steffest
System: Amiga OCS
Runs on Amiga 500 with a 512kb memory expansion and beyond.
Amiga's with a harddisk can use the exe in the "harddisk" folder directly.

Released at RSYNC Demoparty 2026

Tools Used:

Graphics: 
Images where first sketched on paper and ProCreate on iPad and then produced in PhotoShop, including light usage of the "Generative Fill" tool, so I guess they are not 100% AI free.
Images were finalized and pixel optimised in Dpaint.js: https://www.stef.be/dpaint/

Music:
Made in Ableton Live, then rendered to samples and remixed to fit into 4 tracks.
The mod file was composed by hand using BassoonTracker: https://www.stef.be/bassoontracker/

Code:
Home-cooked hardware banging C, with some light sprinkling of assembler here and there. 
(yay! I still can't believe that actually worked!)
Compiled with SAS-C on the Amiga (but written in modern editors)
A big thanks to Wei-ju Wu for his YouTube series "Amiga Hardware Programming in C" which pointed me in a direction i could wrap my head around.
The blitter routines are heavily based on his examples.
Also a big shoutout to Gigabates and Platon42: getting a peek in your awesome toolchains and looking through your code is very inspiring and guiding.
